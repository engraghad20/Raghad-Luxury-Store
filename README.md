 🛍️ Raghad’ Luxury Store
Description:
A fully functional e-commerce website I independently developed to simulate a luxury cosmetics shopping experience. The project reflects my ability to build complete web solutions from front-end design to back-end logic and data handling.

My Role & Contributions:

Designed and implemented a responsive, user-centered interface using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

Developed a dynamic product display and interactive shopping cart with real-time updates.

Built a secure user authentication system (registration & login) using PHP.

Managed data persistence through structured JSON files for users, products, and orders.

Ensured clean, scalable code architecture for future feature expansion (e.g., payment integration, product reviews).

Focused on UI/UX refinement, ensuring smooth navigation and a consistent luxury aesthetic across devices.
